      The GPX Smoother lets you load a GPX file, and smooth out the elevation, to make it easier to ride in your
      favourite trainer software.
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>Smooth - uses simple box-score smoothing to smooth the elevation over 5 points.</li>
      <li>Set Range - lets you set the maximum and minimum slope.</li>
      <li>Flatten - lets you set the maximum change in slope between any two points.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Slide the triangular handles on the smaller graph to select only a portion of the ride to smooth.
