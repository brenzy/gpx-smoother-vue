# gpx-smoother-vue

The GPX smoother is being ported to Vue.js.  This will make it easier to import some more complicated smoothing algorithms.

## ToDo List

This is a work in progress...
- [ ] try removing points according to a distance-based criteria in order to smooth the path (see http://www.thescrapyard.org/software/gpxsmooth.html#algorithm)
- [ ] input validation
- [ ] browser compatibility
- [ ] map the route
- [ ] accept more than one file type (fit, tcx, kml)
- [ ] try some different UI alternatives for less scrolling
